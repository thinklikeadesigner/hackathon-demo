{briefing_note}

## User Message
{user_message}

## Agent Response
{agent_response}

## Tool Calls Made
{tool_summary}

## Scoring Criteria (0.0 to 1.0, or null if not applicable)

1. **signal_extraction**: Did the agent correctly identify and categorize signals from the user's input? Were the right signal types assigned (user_signal, churn_signal, feature_request, market_move, metric, decision)? Was anything missed or miscategorized? Score null if the user didn't provide business data to extract.

2. **memory_grounding**: Did the response reference specific signals, memories, or past data rather than giving generic advice? 1.0 = every claim grounded in specific data. 0.0 = pure generic advice with no data references.

3. **briefing_quality**: (Only for scheduled briefings, null otherwise) Did the briefing surface patterns across signals rather than just listing them? Did it connect signals to hypotheses? Did it identify actionable insights?

4. **tool_efficiency**: Were the tool calls necessary and sufficient? Penalize: redundant recalls, calling tools whose data wasn't used, missing obvious tool calls (e.g., not using recall before answering a question about past data). Score null if no tool calls were expected.

## Response Format

Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text:

{{"signal_extraction": {{"score": 0.8, "reason": "brief explanation"}}, "memory_grounding": {{"score": 0.9, "reason": "brief explanation"}}, "briefing_quality": {{"score": null, "reason": "not a briefing"}}, "tool_efficiency": {{"score": 0.7, "reason": "brief explanation"}}}}"""
